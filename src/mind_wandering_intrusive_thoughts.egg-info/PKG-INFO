Welcome our the project !!!
## BACKGROUND TO THIS PROJECT
   This project investigates how different aspects of mind-wandering predict intrusive thoughts across various cognitive tasks measured by an after imagining questionnaire and explores whether these predictions differ between men and women. The cognitive tasks took place under EEG measurements.
   The dataset includes 10 mind-wandering dimensions collected in each of three sessions.
   After every of the five cognitive tasks (Eyes-Open, Eyes-Closed, Music, Memory, and Subtraction), participants answered the Mini NYC-Q questionnaire, measuring various mental processes, we will focus on (item 12) intrusive thoughts.
   By aggregating the scores from each of the three sessions into mean value, we will analyze which dimensions are the strongest predictors of intrusive thoughts and assess gender-specific patterns. If direct predictions are unclear, we will explore indirect impacts on mood or other variables, contributing to the refinement of experimental designs and understanding of cognitive processes.


    OUR RESEARCH QUESTION:
        How different dimensions of mind-wandering predict intrusive thoughts across various cognitive tasks. Furthermore, it investigates whether these relationships vary between male and female participants.


##### HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT'S SCIRIPTS #####
## 1. GENERAL AND PREWORKING SETS
   make sure you have the correct python version 3.13.0 by writing in the terminal python --version
## 2. VIRTUAL ENVIROMENT ACTIVATION
       First when working on this project install and activate a virtual enviroment to make sure there is a consistency, and avoid conflicts with system packages outside of this project.


        activate virtual enviroment using
        venv\Scripts\activate   in the Terminal
## 3. PIP INSTALL RELEVANT PACKAGES (see also in requirements.txt)
   To use the project properly with all its libraries,
   run in the terminal (in the venv):
   1.
   pip install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
   afterwards also install stubs for pandas as:


   2.
   pip install pandas-stubs


   3.
   pip install --upgrade seaborn


   4.
   pip install types-seaborn


   5.
   pip install mypy


   6.
   pip install --upgrade statsmodels


   7.
   pip install --upgrade scipy
   
   after it run everything check if everything installed properly using:
   pip list, then the output in the terminal should be:

## 4. DEFINE CORRECT PATH
   1. To use this project you will first need to open the Data Set this project working on,
   in order to do this you need to copy the csv file path from the data folder by pressing it with the right click and choose "Copy Path".
   2. After copy path the you need to paste it in the main.py file,
       it will look like this, in the 23 line of th code:
            path = "PASTE\YOUR\PATH\HERE\participants.the.one.that.works.csv"
            df = pd.read_csv( path)
       dont forget to put "" before and after

## 6. FUNCTIONS AND EXPLANATION
   In this section you can find all the functions used in this project and in which modules to find them:
   For example..
       module_name.py:
           function1 -
               explanantion
           function2 -
               explanantion
           function3 -
               explanantion
           etc....




       new_data_frames.py:
       This file is made to clean, manage and extracting the relevant data we will need in order to answer our
       research question.


           def remove_outliers -
             This function replaces outliers in numeric columns of the dataset with NaN. Outliers are identified as values outside 1.5 times the Interquartile Range (IQR).
           def meaning_the_sessions -
           This function computes mean values for groups of columns representing different sessions ( _session1, _session2,_session3) and creates new mean columns. It excludes invalid or completely missing columns.
           def separating_genders -
          This function separates the dataset into two subsets based on the 'sex' column: one for males and one for females. It ensures the 'sex' column is properly formatted before filtering
